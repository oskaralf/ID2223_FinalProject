# Data 
Electricity price data gathered through Elprisetjustnu.se, through:

Weather data gathered through Open Meteo API, through:
https://open-meteo.com/en/docs


Modelt trained on data from 2022-11-01 until 2024-12-18. 


# Notebook 1 - Backfill
Stores the weather data and price data into feature stores for SE4 in sweden, with the weather forecast data based on the coordinates of Lule√•. 
Data from 1st Nov. 2022.

The features are 
    hourly_data["temperature_2m"]
    hourly_data["precipitation"]
    hourly_data["snow_depth"]
    hourly_data["pressure_msl"]
    hourly_data["cloud_cover"]
    hourly_data["wind_speed_10m"]
    hourly_data["wind_speed_100m"]
    hourly_data["wind_direction_10m"]
    hourly_data["wind_direction_100m"]

# Notebook 2 - Pipeline
Loads the feature groups, electricity_price_data and weather_data to insert the forecast weather data, that cna be used for daily scheduling purposes. 

# Notebook 3 - Training
Trains a XGBoost model with hourly data based on the historical data. Stores it in the model registry in Hopsworks for inference

# Notebook 4 - Inference
Loads the model from Hopsworks, extracts the weather forecast data from the feature group and predicts 7 days in advance.
